# iot_parkhaus_android

This Project has been developed in the HSD. The aim was to create a utilisation-monitoring tool for parking garages. We build a Sensor-network monitoring each parking-spot, transmitting the data using the TheThings Network with LoRAWAN transmitters and receivers. To visualize the results an Android-App was created, which is the content of this repo.
